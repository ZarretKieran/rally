## Q&A Prep

### Common Questions

**Q: "How does the calendar integration work?"**
A: "In the MVP, it's UI only. The production version will use Google Calendar API with OAuth to read availability and create events automatically."

**Q: "How does the AI actually work?"**
A: "It analyzes multiple factors: mutual calendar availability, shared interests from onboarding, past hangout patterns, time preferences, and activity preferences. The confidence score reflects how well the suggestion matches all these factors."

**Q: "What if my friends don't use Rally?"**
A: "You can invite them via email right from the app. The value proposition is strong - everyone wants easier hangout planning. Plus, we're planning sponsored hangouts (free food!) as an adoption incentive."

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
A: "Three revenue streams: 1) Sponsored hangouts from local businesses, 2) Premium features (advanced AI, unlimited friends), 3) B2B for corporate team building."

**Q: "What about privacy?"**
A: "Calendar data is only used for availability matching, never shared. Users control what info is visible to friends. Full privacy controls in settings."

**Q: "Why would I use this instead of just texting?"**
A: "Rally removes the friction. Instead of 10+ messages back and forth ('when are you free?' 'what should we do?' 'where?'), you get AI suggestions in one click. Plus, relationship tracking helps you stay connected with ALL your friends, not just your closest ones."
